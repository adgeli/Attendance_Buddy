## Project Objective 

![readme_title_img](Images/readme_title_img.png)

The purpose of this project is to connect the computing power of emotion-sensing libraries to promote the wellbeing of indivudals. 

Current circumstances require students to depend on online learning practices to complete their education. Currently, a pressing concern is the emotional wellbeing of students participating in online learning classes. By applying the data collection and analysis of emotion-sensing libraries in machine leanring has the potential to assist teachers in identifying the emotional wellbeing levels of their students. 

### Objective Outcome

Attendance Buddy portrays an application based virtual assistant helping teachers and students take attendance and monitor students feelings throughout the week through machine learning concepts. Additionally, the integrated use of Google Docs allows teachers to keep track of the data Attendance Buddy provides. 

### Future Directions 

To continue developing the Attendance Buddy application, a goal of the design team is to have the application provide data analysis rather than teachers creating their own conclusions based on the recorded data. In the future, Attendance Budddy will have the ability to monitor the data it collects from students, analyze the emotions inputted on a monthly basis, and finally, recommened alternative lesson plans to assist improve the wellbeing of students if required.
