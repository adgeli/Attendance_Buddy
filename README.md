## Project Objective 

![readme_title_img](Images/readme_title_img.png)

The purpose of this project is to connect the computing power of emotion-sensing libraries to promote the wellbeing of indivudals. 

Current circumstances require students to depend on online learning practices to complete their education. Currently, a pressing concern is the emotional wellbeing of students participating in online learning classes. By applying the data collection and analysis of emotion-sensing libraries in machine leanring has the potential to assist teachers in identifying the emotional wellbeing levels of their students. 

### Objective Outcome 

![readme-gif2](Images/videogif_2.gif)

Attendance Buddy portrays an application based virtual assistant helping teachers and students take attendance and monitor students feelings throughout the week through machine learning concepts. Additionally, the integrated use of Google Docs allows teachers to keep track of the data Attendance Buddy provides. 

### Future Directions 

To continue developing the Attendance Buddy application, a goal of the design team is to have the application provide data analysis rather than teachers creating their own conclusions based on the recorded data. In the future, Attendance Budddy will have the ability to monitor the data it collects from students, analyze the emotions inputted on a monthly basis, and finally, recommened alternative lesson plans to assist improve the wellbeing of students if required. 

To further understand and explore our groups design process and prototype outcome, please review our [Design Reflection](design_process.md) document.

## Deployment 

To deploy both prototypes includes in this Design for Wellbeing Affective App assignment the user will require an MIT App Inventor Account. 

Users can follow [this link](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) to the MIT App Inventor website to create an account. 

Once an acount is created, the user will be able to import one or both of the .aia files to their personal MIT App Inventor account to view the backend development of the application. In addition, users will requireaccess to the MIT emulator to view the frontend of the application or access to an Android device. Further instructions to launch applications created in MIT App Inventor can be found [here](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

## Navigating the Repository

### Attendance Buddy App

![readme_gif1](Images/readme_gif1.gif)

The first component of the assignment is to deliver an MIT App Inventor application consisting of an emotion-sensing machine learning library to promote the concept of personal wellbeing. 

User's are able to navigate to the `attendancebuddy.aia` file and import it into their personal MIT App Inventor accounts to view the application. 

Additionally, users can view the first prototype application by viewing the (Prototype 1 Directoy)(Prototype_1_Files)

### Design Reflection 

The second component of the assignment is to deliver a design reflection outling the design process, objective, evalaution, and future directions of the porject. 

For user ease, this file can be viewed [here](design_process.md)

### Demo Video
